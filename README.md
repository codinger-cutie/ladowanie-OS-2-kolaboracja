# Plans
1. Make ping-pong with loading ball
2. write bootloader
3. distribution of a Linux with browser on load with fullscreen on Raspberry Pi
4. add my BshBin lang to it
BshBin ~~is not published for now~~ [BshBin/ByteBinUtils](https://github.com/kashumy/ByteBinUtils) because this lang can only make functions and draw and be converted to html
6. Make more stuffs
